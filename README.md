# Portfolio
My first public repo + attempt to make my own Portfolio website with what I know so far :)

[Trello board](https://trello.com/b/xNTDDw2v/alvins-portfolio-site) for this project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
